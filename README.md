# Speedway Cloud Storage 🌐
A fictional business that provides cloud-hosting services for those interested in signing up for three types of monthly plans of basic, pro and enterprise. Each plan has its own benefits and drawbacks compared to each other. Potential subscribers are encouraged to try the 14-day free trial to see if they like the products before commiting fully to purchasing a subscription. This project is made from Tailwindcss V4 and Node.js to demonstrate component based CSS and learning how to use Tailwind syntax and positioning elements instead of vanilla CSS or the framework Bootstrap.

## How To Use The Product Page 💰
Simply hover the mouse over the price cards to have each card zoom in for better readability. This allows the all the text and button inside each price card to expand to capture the attention of potential subscribers but, allow people to read large enough text before choosing a plan.
